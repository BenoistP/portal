# SOAPðŸ§¼
Soap is a next generation token dispenser, built on Solana. It lets you create and distribute digital collectibles to anyone easily. Give attendance tokens to your event's visitors, airdrop them the aftermovie, and send them an invitation for the next occasion. If you're a Spaces kind of dude, let your listeners get soaps for each space, and reward your biggest fans through airdrops and exclusive content.

## Mobile first
This portal has a one of soap's core innovations implemented already. It lets you connect your wallet in a mobile browser. Open Safari on your iPhone, and sign in with your Phantom or Solflare wallet seamlessly.

## MVP Roadmap
[X] **Gallery**: See all the soaps you own in one place.

[] **Dealer**: A way of distributing soaps. Eg. a QR code or link that people get a soap with.

[] **Maker**: A tool for anyone to create soaps permissionlessly and set up a soap dealer in a self-service way. 



# Next.JS Original docs

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
