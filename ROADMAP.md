# Development Roadmap - 4 highly important / 1 low prio

## Solflare support - 3
Solflare is implementing deeplinks into their application, and it will use the same API schema as Phantom's.
The portal should have the button ready to go live before Solflare's update.

## Glow support - 2
Glow should be supported as well through whatever method in the browser.

## Animations
There's no niceness in the portal. Needs some animations.
